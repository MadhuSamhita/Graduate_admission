# University Admission Dataset Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the University Admission Dataset Analysis and Prediction project! This project involves exploring a dataset containing information about university applicants and their chance of admission. The goal is to analyze the data, visualize relationships, and build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of admission based on various features.

## Loading and Exploration:
Loaded a dataset containing university admission information.
Explored the dataset's shape, columns, and data types.
Checked for missing values and duplicates in the data.

## Data Visualization:
Created a correlation heatmap to visualize feature relationships.
Plotted a count plot to show applicant distribution by university rating.
Generated a scatter plot depicting the correlation between CGPA and admission chance.

## Data Preparation:
Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

## Model Training and Evaluation:
Utilized various regression models: Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.
Trained each model on the training data.
Made predictions on the test data and calculated metrics (MSE, MAE, R2) to evaluate model performance.

## Model Selection:
Identified the Gradient Boosting Regressor as a strong candidate due to its superior performance and ensemble benefits.
Noted its potential advantage in mitigating overfitting.
